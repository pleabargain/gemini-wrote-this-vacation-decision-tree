## How It Works

The app uses a JSON-based decision tree to guide you through a series of questions, such as:
- What is your budget?
- Do you prefer beaches or mountains?
- Is this a family trip or a romantic trip?
- Do you want to travel internationally?
- What type of holiday are you interested in (e.g., beach, culture, adventure)?

Based on your answers, the app provides personalized vacation recommendations.

## Example Use Case

1. Select your budget (e.g., "Under $1000").
2. Choose your preference (e.g., "Beaches").
3. Specify the type of trip (e.g., "Family Trip").
4. Get a recommendation (e.g., "Consider a local family-friendly beach vacation.").
